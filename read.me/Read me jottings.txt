Decided to make a playlist generator as I love music and finding new songs. Torn between this and Recipe finder



JamJar is a Site that allows users to play a related playlist based on the work they want to get done 
(Work, Study, Workout, meditate [moods to be added soon]). Once completed, they can see how long they listened for,
 as well as how many breaks they took. how many songs they played and/or skipped. They can then listen again or find 
 the playlis on spotify directly via a link.


Changing it to play pre-selected playlists instead of finding ones from each account. PLaylists may be personalized if logged in as they work off the persons account.

Initally wanted to use JS to append each subratdio option, but HTML was quicker with so few options, plan to update to JS when expanding site?

2. PUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player returns 404
üìç Problem:
Spotify‚Äôs API says the device isn‚Äôt found, because your web player is not yet active.

‚úÖ Fix:
Ensure the Spotify Web Player is open and active before calling the /play endpoint.

Spotify only activates a device after:

The SDK is fully initialized.

The user has interacted with it (clicked play at least once).

üí° Pro tip:
You can programmatically ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the player by playing a silent track or prompting the user to click the play button once in the web UI.
