Decided to make a playlist generator as I love music and finding new songs. Torn between this and Recipe finder



JamJar is a Site that allows users to play a related playlist based on the work they want to get done 
(Work, Study, Workout, meditate [moods to be added soon]). Once completed, they can see how long they listened for,
 as well as how many breaks they took. how many songs they played and/or skipped. They can then listen again or find 
 the playlis on spotify directly via a link.
